# Week 3 - Eigenfaces

## Progress
- Didn't reach the progress that I was supposed to due to having to learn some things about linear algebra
- Progressed to 'create reduced eigenface space', although it still needs to be completed

## Key takeaways:
- Tensors, eigenvalues and eigenvectors and how to use them
- Learned to better utilize Python syntax and the Numpy lib

## What I've found difficult
- Slow progress this week is due to me attending professional events such as AI day and Slush, hopefully it is taken into account when assessing this weeks progress!
- What to actually test at this point with unit tests, since most functions are mere abstractions of a few Numpy methods.

## What's next
- I will complete the algorithm and prepare for analysis of different kinds of datasets and evaluation criterias
- Unit testing
