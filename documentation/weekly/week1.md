# Week 1 - Eigenfaces

## Progress
- Got familiar with 
	- the eigenfaces method
	- related concepts such as principal component analysis

- The program has been initialized with folder structure using poetry

## Key takeaways:
- General flow of the eigenfaces method for face recognition learned
- Better understanding of poetry

## What I've found difficult
- So far so good

## What's next
- I will complete the first 4 phases of the eigenfaces method as described in [the requirement spec](https://github.com/ni-eminen/eigenface/blob/master/documentation/requirement-specification.md#algorithms-and-data-structures-required-for-this-project).
