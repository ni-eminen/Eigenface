# Week 2 - Eigenfaces

## Progress
- Learned how the eigenfaces method works in more detail.
- Began writing the eigenfaces implementation with Python. Experimented by implementing some of the matrix and vector operation manually, instead of using Numpy, to understand the program better.
- Implemented phases 1-5 of the eigenfaces algorithm.
- Discovered a good dataset to use for training, LFW - Labeled Faces in the Wild - faces aligned.

## Key takeaways:
- Some Numpy vector and matrix tools learned
- Averaging matrices, vectors
- Learned what kind of dataset to use for eigenfaces

## What I've found difficult
- Importing user modules not working, so I could not implement the tests in time
- Wholly understanding what is going on and why it leads to accurate face recognition

## What's next
- I will complete the next 5 phases of the eigenfaces method as described in [the requirement spec](https://github.com/ni-eminen/eigenface/blob/master/documentation/requirement-specification.md#algorithms-and-data-structures-required-for-this-project).
  - i.e. from onwards from phase 'calculate eigenvectors of the covariance matrix'
