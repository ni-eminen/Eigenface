# Week 5 - Eigenfaces

## Progress
- Documentation is now on par. Codecov testing added to github
- Began testing whether multi id prediction (recognition requires multiple of the closest matches to be the same id, otherwise the image is not recognized) is better than just basing the prediction on the closest match.
- Did not have time to complete the comparison due to unexpected issues

## Key takeaways:
- Documentation, testing and coherency of the Jupyter notebook have been increased due to the peer review requests.

## What I've found difficult
- For some reason I couldn't get the multi id predictions to work yet, I will look into them asap to get them ready.


## What's next
- After the multi id prediction has been evaluated, I will start testing different ways to determine the closest match and see how that affects accuracy.
