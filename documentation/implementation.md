# Program structure
Eigenfaces program structure is very simple, with the main algorithm in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) located in [eigenfaces.ipynb](https://github.com/ni-eminen/eigenface/blob/master/src/eigenfaces.ipynb). A .py file has been generated off the notebook and is located here [eigenfaces.py](https://github.com/ni-eminen/eigenface/blob/master/src/eigenfaces.py).

The algorithm uses some helper functions and methods that are located in [helpers.py](https://github.com/ni-eminen/eigenface/blob/master/src/helpers.py). For functions that need contextual information, a class named [EigenfaceHelpers](https://github.com/ni-eminen/eigenface/blob/44b492de480c874266d4333b446b2bf9aec4646f/src/helpers.py#L10) has been created. Stand-alone functions are located in the same file.
